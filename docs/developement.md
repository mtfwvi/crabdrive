# Developement

Prerequisites:
- Rust 1.85.0 or later installed.
- TCP port `2722` available on the host.

## Server
You can start the server by entering `cargo run server`. Once the server has started successfully, a message indicating the address on which the server is listening should appear on the console. The default address is http://127.0.0.1:2722/ or http://localhost:2722/.

Pressing `Crtl + C` will gracefully shutdown the server.
